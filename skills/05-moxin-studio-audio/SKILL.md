# Moxin Studio Audio

## 1. Overview

Moxin uses cpal for input/output and a circular buffer AudioPlayer for playback. Keep sample rate and metadata consistent with dataflow.

## 2. Audio workflow

1. Initialize `AudioManager` and populate device dropdowns.
2. Start mic monitoring and update UI on timer.
3. Send buffer status to Dora from actual buffer fill.
4. Write audio with participant and question_id.
5. Use smart reset to discard stale audio.
