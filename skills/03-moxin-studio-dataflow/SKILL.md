# Moxin Studio Dataflow

## 1. Overview

Moxin apps rely on Dora dataflows with dynamic nodes. Follow naming and signal contracts so the bridge layer can discover and connect.

## 2. Dataflow workflow

1. Start from an existing `voice-chat.yml` (fm or debate).
2. Keep dynamic node IDs with `moxin-` prefix; add suffixes if needed.
3. Wire control and audio signals to `conference-controller`.
4. Ensure log outputs use `*_log` or `*_status` naming.
5. Validate with `dora up` and check UI connection status.
