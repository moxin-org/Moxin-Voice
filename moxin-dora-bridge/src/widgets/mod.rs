//! Widget-specific bridge implementations
//!
//! Each widget type has its own bridge that connects to dora as a dynamic node:
//! - `moxin-audio-player`: Receives audio, forwards to UI for playback
//! - `moxin-system-log`: Receives logs from multiple nodes
//! - `moxin-prompt-input`: Sends user prompts to LLM
//! - `moxin-aec-input`: Captures mic audio with AEC, sends to ASR
//! - `moxin-audio-input`: Sends pre-recorded audio to ASR
//!
//! Note: LED visualization is calculated in screen.rs from output waveform
//! (more accurate since it reflects what's actually being played)
